BODY.

<script>
  let body = document.body;

  body.innerHTML = "<!--" + body.tagName + "-->";

  alert( body.firstChild.data ); // BODY
</script>

The content of <body> is replaced with the comment. The comment is <!--BODY-->, because body.tagName == "BODY". As we remember, tagName is always uppercase in HTML.
The comment is now the only child node, so we get it in body.firstChild.
The data property of the comment is its contents (inside <!--...-->): "BODY".
